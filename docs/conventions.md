# Conventions

This document defines syntax rules, naming conventions, file boundaries, and automation patterns for this project.

## Universal DateTime Standard

All projects in this ecosystem MUST follow these datetime rules:

1. **UTC at Rest** — All databases and caches store datetimes in UTC with `TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE`. Banned: naive or local-time storage.
2. **ISO-8601 with Offset / Epoch ms at API Boundaries** — APIs transmit datetimes as Unix Epoch milliseconds (int64) or ISO-8601 with offset (e.g., `2026-07-23T14:30:00+00:00`). Banned: timezone-naive strings.
3. **Clock Injection** — All current-time access must go through an injectable `Clock` abstraction. Banned: direct `new Date()`, `datetime.now()`, `time.Now()` in business logic.
4. **Dual-Representation for Future Events** — Calendar events expose both `event_start_local` (with timezone) and `event_start_epoch_ms` (absolute).
5. **`TZ=UTC` Infrastructure** — All environments run with `TZ=UTC`. Timezone display is a client-layer responsibility only.

## SOLID Programming Guidelines

Enforce these SOLID principles and pragmatic guardrails in every implementation:

1. **SRP** — One reason to change per module. Split merged concerns.
2. **OCP** — Open for extension, closed for modification. Use composition over inheritance.
3. **LSP** — Subtypes must be substitutable. Ban `NotImplementedError` overrides.
4. **ISP** — Small role-specific interfaces. Ban monolithic god-interfaces.
5. **DIP** — Depend on abstractions, not concretions. Core layer must not import adapters.

**Pragmatic Guardrails:** No abstraction for <3 trivial operations. Only extract interfaces with 2+ implementations. Apply YAGNI strictly. Prefer simpler designs unless a measurable requirement forces complexity.

## Universal Financial Ledger Standard

All financial, transactional, and countable data operations MUST enforce these mandates:

1. **Snapshot-on-Write for Mutable Totals:** Whenever a financial amount, inventory count, or balance is mutated, persist a read-only snapshot of the preceding state in the same transaction (sidecar table, audit log, or WAL). Banned: mutating without preserving the prior value.
2. **Mandatory `$ifNull` Precedence:** All aggregation queries on monetary fields MUST use explicit null-handling (`COALESCE`, `ISNULL`, `$ifNull`). Banned: passing nullable columns into mathematical operators.
3. **Observability Alerting on Discrepancies:** If a computed total diverges from its line-item sum by more than 0.01, emit a high-severity alert and prevent finalization.
4. **Deep Config Merging for Financial Settings:** Financial configuration updates MUST deeply merge nested properties. Banned: shallow object spread on financial config objects.

## Defensive Shell Protocol (DSP)

When writing or reviewing bash scripts, cron jobs, or container orchestration commands:

1. **Mandatory Strict Mode:** All scripts MUST start with `set -euo pipefail`.
2. **Banned Error Masking:** `2>/dev/null` is STRICTLY FORBIDDEN on data-generation, backup, archive, or database commands.
3. **No Post-Redirect Status Checks:** Never use `command > file; if [ $? -eq 0 ]` — the shell creates the file before running the command, masking failures.
4. **Sidecar Isolation for Hostless Backups:** Never rely on host file staging for Docker volume backups. Always use ephemeral containers (`docker run --rm -v volume:/data:ro alpine tar...`) with read-only mounts.

## Task-Number Reference Discipline

Task numbers are provenance for humans, not reasoning material for the model. A bare task number in visible prompt prose invites hallucination: the model treats it as load-bearing context it cannot resolve.

1. **Allowed Homes (only):** code comments (`#`, `//`), `CHANGELOG.md` entries, task files, history archives, and HTML-comment markers (`<!-- -->`).
2. **Forbidden Homes:** visible prose in prompt fragments, agent instruction files, skill instructions, registry lines, section headings, and any Markdown the Brain or Hands reads as operating instructions.
3. **Authoring Rule:** when writing or editing prompt-facing Markdown, strip task-number parentheticals. Record provenance in the task file and CHANGELOG instead — never in the prompt text itself.
